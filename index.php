                            <dt>INTERESTING THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT BLOOD:</dt>
                            1. Do you know that "O-" blood type is known as universal donor. This means that person having this blood type
                            can donate blood to anyone. Although O is known as the universal blood donor, negative blood types cannot be donated to a positive blood group
                            member. Because the Oâ€“ group lacks both blood group and Rh factor antigens, it is a universal donor.<br>
                            2. Do you know that "AB+" blood type is know as universal acceptor. Because it has no antibodies to A, B, or Rh, AB+ blood is a universal acceptor and may receive red blood cells from any
                            kind of blood donor. This means person having this blood type can accept blood from any blood groups.<br> <br>
